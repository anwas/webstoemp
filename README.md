# Webstoemp

Webstomep is the website of Jérôme Coupé, web designer, front-end developer and teacher from Brussels, Belgium.

Webstoemp is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). It is deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This is my personal website, not a starter kit. The code is open sourced and you are welcome to peek under the hood. I would be really flattered if you were "inspired" by anything I built here but do try to be original.
