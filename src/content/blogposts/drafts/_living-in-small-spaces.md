My brother builds yurts for a living. Went there for a couple of weeks when he was on holidays.

## Small living space

- forces you to be organised and not accumulate things
- everything is within reach
- need a way to isolate, be alone
- storage is a problem, need external storage space (bikes, tools, etc)

## Knowing how it works

- can build large parts of it yourself
- simple technical systems oriented towards repairability
- more human sized and more manageable

## More connection to the outdoor

- need a covered deck with Belgian weather
- can hopefully have a bigger garden than in BXL
- you need loads of windows

## A project

- wooden structure with more width than a tiny house
- try to build most of it myself with assistance
