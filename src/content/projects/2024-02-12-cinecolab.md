Cinécolab is an initiative led by four Belgian film schools working with students, teachers and professionals to reduce the ecological footprint of the film industry. I worked with the team to create a graphical identity and build a website to showcase trainings for students and professionals, publish blogposts and interviews and build a database of curated resources.
